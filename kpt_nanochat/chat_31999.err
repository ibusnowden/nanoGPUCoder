/project/inniang/nanogpu/kpt_nanochat/nanochat/nanochat/checkpoint_manager.py:44: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

2025-12-19 17:42:59,566 - __main__ - [32m[1mINFO[0m - [ASSISTANT] (GPU 0): Living alone would be a lifelong adventure, and there are many benefits to living alone. For one, it provides a sense of stability and routine, which can be comforting and help with daily tasks. Without the distractions of a daily routine, you would be more able to focus and make the most of your downtime. This freedom to explore and learn new things is often associated with increased resilience and adaptability.

Moreover, being alone can also provide an opportunity for personal growth, whether that's through meditation, journaling, or simply being present in the moment. Being able to step out of your shell and experience the world in a new light can also boost your self-esteem and confidence. You may find that you have access to a wealth of learning resources, including podcasts, online courses, and books, that can help you develop new skills and perspectives.

Lastly, living alone can also provide a sense of accountability and motivation, which are often linked to improved mental health and well-being. Many people are naturally more resilient and able to tackle challenging situations with greater ease, which is a key factor in their overall well-being and happiness. Overall, living alone offers a unique combination of freedom, clarity, and a sense of fulfillment that can be hard to find in solo endeavors.

2025-12-19 17:44:30,521 - __main__ - [32m[1mINFO[0m - [ASSISTANT] (GPU 0): To solve this problem, we need to know how to use the power rule in conjunction with multiplication to isolate x. The power rule states that if we have a function of the form f(x) = x^n, where n is a real number, then the derivative of f(x) must be zero when n is a real number.

For our problem, we can find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 with respect to x by applying the power rule:

f'(x) = 3x^(3-2x)) * (x^2)

Using the power rule, we get:

d/dx [(x^2)/(x^2)] = 3x^(2-2x)

Now, we can use the product rule to find the derivative of f(x):

d/dx (f(x)) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)

Substituting f(x) = x^3 and u'(x) = 3x^(2-2x), we get:

d/dx [(x^2)/(x^2)] = (3x^(2-2x)) * (x^2)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

d/dx [(x^2)/(x^2)] = 3x^(2-2x)
