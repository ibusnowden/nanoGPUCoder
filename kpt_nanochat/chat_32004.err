/project/inniang/nanogpu/kpt_nanochat/nanochat/nanochat/checkpoint_manager.py:44: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

Introduction

The first and most fundamental aspect in the history of science is the relationship between the atomic and molecular worlds. Ewic, commonly referred to as the first atomic bomb, was the first to form solid and stable molecules, and it was the first to be made up of hundreds of subatomic particles. The atomic world is the only solid state of matter with a diameter of 8.9 billion, and the most basic form of a solid is in the form of atoms. As the atomic nucleus grows, the atomic number increases, and it becomes more difficult to contain these massive particles and particles. This increasing size makes it harder to contain these massive particles. In order to avoid the enormous size of the subatomic particles, it is necessary to develop new methods for isolating these particles, which are the building blocks of nuclear physics. The discovery of Ewic, a nucleus with a diameter of 8.9 billion, was an active area of research in this area, and it is expected to have a nuclear explosion. However, the atomic nuclei cannot overcome the difficulties that Ewic faced, and the atomic nuclei are unable to overcome these limitations. These limitations make it harder to determine the exact mass and charge of the particles they contain. Ewic, in general, does not have mass, and it is not possible to distinguish between particles of mass that do not occupy the same energy state. Therefore, while the atomic and molecular worlds are filled with heavy elements, they are not completely empty, and only in part are the particles of mass connected to it. Ewic, however, is the first to construct atomic nuclei in an endlessly complex manner, and it will require a great deal of energy and resources.
